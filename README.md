Basic moves are Simple: *turn left* & *turn right*
Then few advanced moves are: 

> Accelerate
> > You can accelerate with your upper direction key.
> > You can get a point by eating shiny little shards in game, and each shard gives you 1 gauge.
> > 1 gauge == 2 seconds of accelerate

> previous Key copy
> > You can use *prev key copy* with your lower direction key.
> > If you press left key and then press lower key, lower key is left key. In opposite case, Vice Versa.
> > This move is usually used for fast U-turn
