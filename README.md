Game **NeonSnake** is variation of typical arcade game 'Snake' but it's 3D.

You can control Snake in first-person-view, using direction keys

***



# references
The game is originated with base of the game '**Snake**', which is classic and timeless product.

```bash
ALL codes are generated with Gemini AI
```

# Control
Basic moves are Simple: *turn left* & *turn right*


Then few advanced moves are: 


> Accelerate
> > You can accelerate with your upper direction key.
> > You can get a point by eating shiny little shards in game, and each shard gives you 1 gauge.
> > 1 gauge == 2 seconds of accelerate

> previous Key copy
> > You can use *prev key copy* with your lower direction key.
> > If you press left key and then press lower key, lower key is left key. In opposite case, Vice Versa.
> > This move is usually used for fast U-turn


So it can be presented like this:

| Keys | ↑ | ↓ | ← | → |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Turn | ` | ` | left | right |
| Special | accelerate | prev key copy | ` | ` |

`    

+) If you are *horizontally* or *vertically* at the same line with shard, the shard will shine brightly at **Green color**.
